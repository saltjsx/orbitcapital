We’re excited to announce that Orbit Capital has led a $50 million Series A investment in T7 Chat, an innovative usage‑based AI chat platform that’s rapidly gaining traction. T7 Chat has achieved an impressive $5M ARR and is demonstrating strong month‑over‑month growth — a clear signal that businesses and consumers alike want flexible, usage‑priced access to powerful conversational AI.

## Why we invested

T7 Chat stands out for several reasons:

- Usage-based pricing that aligns cost with value, lowering adoption friction for businesses and developers.
- A product-led growth flywheel: rapid onboarding, measurable ROI, and strong retention metrics.
- A differentiated technical approach that supports high-throughput, low-latency interactions and sophisticated control over model behavior.
- Early revenue proof: $5M ARR at Series A is a rare and compelling combination of product-market fit and commercial momentum.

Orbit Capital believes usage‑based models are key to unlocking broader adoption of AI services — they reduce upfront risk for customers and create scalable, predictable revenue engines for builders. T7 Chat is executing on that promise.

## How T7 Chat will use the capital

The $50M Series A will accelerate T7 Chat’s roadmap across four primary areas:

- Product and engineering (45%): advance core model integrations, fine‑tuning workflows, developer tooling, and reliability at scale.
- Go‑to‑market (25%): expand sales, partnership, and developer outreach to accelerate enterprise adoption and platform integrations.
- Infrastructure and security (15%): invest in low-latency serving, observability, and enterprise‑grade security & compliance.
- Hiring and operations (15%): attract senior talent across ML, product, and customer success to sustain high-velocity growth.

## What this means for customers and partners

- Faster feature velocity and more robust developer SDKs and APIs.
- Improved SLA and enterprise readiness for large deployments.
- Continued commitment to usage-based pricing and transparent billing.
- Expanded integrations with workflow and analytics platforms to surface ROI.

## Looking ahead
