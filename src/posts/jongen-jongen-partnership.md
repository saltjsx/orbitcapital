## Key Thesis Areas

1. Infrastructure Efficiency (accelerators, model routing, inference orchestration)
2. Data Moats & Vertical Foundation Models
3. Agentic Workflows & Ops Automation
4. Trust, Governance & Security Layers
5. Edge & On‑Device Optimization

## Market Structure Snapshot

| Layer                      | Competitive Intensity | Margin Outlook       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Silicon / Accelerators     | High                  | Compressing          |
| Orchestration / Infra SaaS | Rising                | Healthy (mid 70s GM) |
| Vertical Models            | Fragmenting           | Bifurcated           |
| Application Layer          | Extremely High        | Narrowing            |

## Valuation Discipline

We segment AI companies into four archetypes and apply distinct forward multiple bands:

- Infra Enablers: Usage expansion + deterministic upsell. (8–12x NTM ARR)
- Data / Model Moats: Longer build cycles, deferred monetization. (10–18x where retention >135%)
- Workflow Automation: Faster payback required. (5–9x NTM ARR)
- Applied Specialist Agents: Optionality heavy, higher decay risk. (3–6x)

## Diligence Radar (Excerpt Checklist)

- Retention Cohort Shape (Month 12 vs Month 3 normalize)
- Gross Margin Net of Pass‑Through Compute
- Data Acquisition Flywheel Velocity
- Latency / Accuracy Tradeoff Benchmarks
- Regulatory Exposure (EU AI Act classification)
- Security Posture (model exfiltration pathways)

## Risk Vectors

| Risk                     | Mitigation Approach                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Compute Cost Volatility  | Dynamic routing + forward reserved capacity      |
| Model Commodity Pressure | Data gravity + proprietary fine‑tuning pipelines |
| Regulatory Drag          | Early audit mapping & policy engagement          |
| Talent Dilution          | Internal AI tooling & knowledge capture          |

## Strategy Note

We believe durable winners pair proprietary data leverage with distribution asymmetry (embedded workflows or infra lock‑in). Pure UI layer plays face accelerating margin compression.
